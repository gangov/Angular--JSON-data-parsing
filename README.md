Yesterday I've made a project with similar functionality to this one using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it can be found [here](https://github.com/gangov/JSON-data-parsing)

Here you can find the implementation using Anguular. 

I've used the [following article](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/building-an-online-store-using-ngrx-store-and-angular) as a main guide on what to do and refactored and edited it, according to my task afterwards.

I've also submitted a PullRequest to the original author's solution, because I thought, that there was a typo in one of the Class names in use. You can review it [here](https://github.com/HackAfro/reactive-fruit-store/pull/1)

I have removed the buttons to add/remove products to the card for this release, but will add these back on in a later release, when I get better understanding of Angular. 

## What this project tought me
- What Angular is
- Working with components
- the RxJS library and how it helps me to update the content and display it on the site.

## Requirements
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)


## To get this started
- You need to first clone this and install any dependencies:
- After unzipping the archive you need to run 'npm install' 
- Right after that run 'node server' to start the server and 'ng serve' to start Angular

Upon using 'git add .' I had the following message:
warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in `current_directory`.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
Researching on that I found that this is caused by my OS, so I hope it won't cause a mess if you're usign something different from Unix
